This is a simple c project for the wdc816cc compiler to create snes roms using the LoROM mapping scheme.
Compile with make.bat

The stack is located in bank 0 $0000-$1FFF
DATA generated by the compiler is stored in bank 7E from $2000-$FFFF
Memory allocated through farmalloc is stored in bank 7F, $0000-$FFFF
The binary compiled can be used directly by emulators.

HiROM seems to work by mapping ROM linearly into snes memory except
the ROM that would map into bank 1 now maps into bank 0`s ROM section.
IE ROM $008000-00FFFF maps to snes $008000-00FFFF 1:1 unlike
in LoROM where $000000-007FFF maps to snes $008000-00FFFF
