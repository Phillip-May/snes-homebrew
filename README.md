# snes-homebrew
A collection of snes homebrew written mostly in C  

General structure is as follows  

assembly: Demo's written entirely in assembly, using arm9's fork of BASS
LegacyWDC816CC: Old demo's written exclusively for wdc816cc
SimpleCDemos: A collection of demo's that work across multiple different c compilers
snes-celeste: My SNES dev 2025 Game Jam submission code 

As a starting point if you want to learn, I would suggest starting with  
SimpleCDemos/CGRAMTest  
and then either following the guide it linked except in C or looking at  
SimpleCDemos/Mode1Sprite  
for a more useful example showing backgrounds and sprites
