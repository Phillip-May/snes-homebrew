# BenchmarkDhrystone
A port of a dhrystone 2.1 benchmark  
An more useful benchmark than the Whetstone benchmark for comparing cpu+compiler performance  
May be a bit obselete as LLVM-MOS is sufficiently strong that it can fully optimize out the test  
but that's also a valid benchmark of the progress on optimizing compilers
