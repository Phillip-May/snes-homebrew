eLua - Lua for microcontrollers
===============================

*eLua* stands for *Embedded Lua* and the project aims to offer the
full implementation of the http://www.lua.org[Lua Programming
Language] to the embedded world, extending it with specific features
for efficient and portable software embedded development. For more
details please visit the link:http://www.eluaproject.net[project
page].

If you've just downloaded *eLua* and are looking to get started check

General Features
----------------

*eLua* allows you to develop and run Lua programs on a wide variety of
microcontrollers.

Some aspects of eLua are:

* *Transforms hardware into a commodity:* Design and code your products for
  eLua and make them as hardware-independent as possible. Upgrade or
  completely change your hardware in the future and save time and money, using
  the approved source code with little or no modifications.

* *Source code portability:* Like in Lua, you program in C, Lua or a mixture
  of both and your program runs in a wide varied of (sometimes radically
  different) platforms and architectures supported. Full control of the
  platform.: eLua runs on the "bare-metal". There is no Operating System
  between your programs and the microcontroller. Develop on targets: fully
  functional Lua and a dedicated shell on the microcontroller itself. No need
  to install a specific development environment on the PC side, other than a
  serial or ehternet console/terminal emulator. You can also use any text
  editor, save your programs in sd/mmc and other media and use them directly
  in your platforms.

* *Flexible products:* Add modern high level script-language capabilities to
  your projects, resulting in highly adaptable, field-programable and
  reconfigurable designs. Efficient (and cheap!) future evolution to your
  systems.

* *Learn embedded:* Simple interactive and interpreted experimenting cycle.
  Use your desktop programming skills to become an embedded systems developer
  in no time and with a lot of fun.

* *Embedded RAD:* Prototype and experiment on a Rapid Aplication Develop
  model. Test your ideas directly on the target platforms and cheap
  development kits. No need for simulators or future code adaptations.

* *Ready to use kits:* A big (and growing!) number of Open Source hardware and
  commercially available platforms supported. Prototype cheap and fast and
  design your final hardware later using the produced code.

* *Longevity:* Add user configuration and scripting capabilities to your
  projects, making them adaptable to the always changing contexts of
  industrial processes, evolving engineering, automation standards, field
  optimizations etc...

* *Worry-free Licence:* eLua is free and open-source software and we promote
  it as much as we can. But our MIT licence (the same as Lua's) allows you to
  use eLua in your commercial and private-code products as well. Nothing to
  ask, no royalties to pay, just tell the world you're using eLua.
