  -- Overview
  overview = [[This module deals with low-level access to CPU (and related modules) functionality, such as reading and writing memory, or 
  enabling and disabling interrupts. It also offers access to platform specific CPU-related constants using a special macro defined in the
  platform's $platform_conf.h$ file, as explained @#cpu_constants@here@.]],

  -- Data structures, constants and types
  structures = 
  {
    { text = [[cpu.INT_GPIOA
cpu.INT_GPIOB
.............
cpu.INT_UDMA]],
      name = "CPU constants",
      desc = [[eLua has a mechanism that lets the user export an unlimited number of constants to the $cpu$ module. Although in theory any kind of constant can be exposed by this module,
one should only use constants related to the CPU and its subsystems (as shown above, where a number of CPU specific interrupt masks are exposed to Lua using this mechanism). To use this
mechanism, just declare the $PLATFORM_CPU_CONSTANTS$ macro in your platform's $platform_conf.h$ file and list all your constants as part of this macro, each enclosed in a special macro called
$_C$. For example, to get the constants listed above declare your $PLATFORM_CPU_CONSTANTS$ macro like this:</p>
~#define PLATFORM_CPU_CONSTANTS\
  _C( INT_GPIOA ),\
  _C( INT_GPIOB ),\
  .................
  _C( INT_UDMA )~
<p>It's worth to note that adding more constants does not increase RAM usage, only Flash usage, so you can expose as many constants as you need without worrying about RAM consumption.<br />
This mechanism is also used to expose interrupt IDs to the CPU module, check @inthandlers.html@here@ for an overview of eLua interrupt support.]]
