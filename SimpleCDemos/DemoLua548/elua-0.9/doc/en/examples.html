<h3>eLua Code Examples</h3>
<p>
Previous to v0.8, official eLua distributions included some games, demos and code examples in
the ROM File System.
</p>
<p>
These examples grew to independent projects and are now maintained by the
community in dedicated pages on the <a href="http://wiki.eluaproject.net/Projects">eLua
Wiki projects section</a>. 
</p>
<p>
There you will also find some tutorials on <a href="http://wiki.eluaproject.net/Boards">how to use them on your kits</a>
 and <a href=http://wiki.eluaproject.net/Tutorials>many others</a>.
</p>
<p>The wiki is maintained by eLua users and you are very welcomed to
register and add your own tutorial contribution or to comment on any other.
